# AGENTS.md

Bootstrap for coding agents working on **nixos**.

Knowledge is split by scope into two Gitea wikis. The repo carries only
`README.md` (operator-facing) and this file.

- **Instance-wide** — `gitea.x.home.arpa/kb/gitea/wiki`: workflow, review rules,
  commit style, dependencies, environment. True in every repo here.
- **This project** — `gitea.x.home.arpa/nix/nixos/wiki`: this repo's own
  facts and decisions.

Run `gidged identity` before working — it prints the reference clone, worktree
and wiki paths, and your git identity. Dump both wikis with `gidged wiki`; do
all work in a worktree (`gidged worktree <branch>`).
